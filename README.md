# [ShapeShifter](https://shapeshifter-zace118.netlify.app/)
A simple web app that will change the rendered shape depending on what button is clicked. A fun project I made after I finished the UA Bootcamp in early May. I wanted to do something like this to work on my CSS and React skills. As of 5/13/20 the app is fully functional, but I intend on continued devlopment. Check below for next steps!

## Next Steps

* CSS Animation - Added a smooth transition from shape to shape to simulate morphing.
* Color Buttons - Create another div of buttons that can change the shape's colors. 
* Night Mode Toggle - Create a toggle that'll switch the background to black/dark grey.
